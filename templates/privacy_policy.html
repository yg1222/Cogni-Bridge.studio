        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take the security of your personal information seriously. Personal identifiable information, such as names and email addresses, is never stored in plain text. Instead, we use industry-standard encryption methods to protect this data both in transit and at rest. Sensitive information, including authentication credentials, is securely stored using encryption techniques that prevent unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to encryption, we implement rigorous screening of all incoming requests to protect against various threats, including SQL injection, OS injection, and other forms of cyberattacks. Our security protocols ensure that data handling processes are compliant with industry best practices, safeguarding the integrity of our systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            While we implement reasonable measures to protect your data, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>
